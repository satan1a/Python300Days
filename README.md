# Python 300 days

## 对 Python 的练习，坚持 300 天

## 每天一个知识点，不追求高大上，但一定要 <strong>理解透彻</strong>

## 新的开始🌻

### 4/6/2020开始，重新开始本项目，以2x0开始记，巩固Python基础，主要方向为网络编程和数据分析脚本编写

~~# 新的开始~~
~~✨9/10/2019 重新开始本项目，以1x0开始记，主要为黑客编程的练习,[参考](https://github.com/xuanhun/PythonHackingBook1)~~

### 鉴于 Python 代码的简洁和相对“零散”，知识点说明大部分以 注释 的形式写在代码中，理解等写在每日项目根目录文件夹中的 README.md 文件中

### 根据 Ebbiinghaus遗忘曲线，每三天简单回顾之前三天写的内容，每礼拜天回顾之前礼拜的内容。

### 不畏天阔谄媚神仙，一人之间山水江湖

<strong>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters</strong>

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
