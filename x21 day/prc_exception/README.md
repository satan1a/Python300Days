# Error Handling
## "try" mechanism
- try: ... except ... finally: ...
- if errors occur, "except" will catch the errors. When "except" finish and there is "finally" sentence, program wll execute the "finally" sentence.
- if there are no errors occurred, we can add "else" sentence to execute corresponding sentence.
